# CBT4

Now implementing UI, CBT4 tries to simulate a UI like other engines, having different buttons and scenes to go. This is a fork of Wiwa engine (more information below).

## UI Controls

- F1 Go to Options page
- F2 Return to Main Menu
- F3 See Crosshair page
- F4 (Hold Down) See the town scene

## Mishaps
### Mishap 1:
At first, we forked Wiwa Engine a few days before starting work in this new fork, but all
of that work got corrupted for some reason. In previous commits of our original fork, the
2D Renderer work completely fine, but for some reason at some given point that stopped working,
and every time we created a button, a check or an image it didn't show up on screen when it
previously did. We tried to revert commits and to download previous versions from the GitHub page, 
but everything seemed to be broken. The only way we managed to fix this error was by forking the
project again, which resulted in this current version.

### Mishap 2:
This isn't really a mishap as it is a limitation of the engine in its current state. The 2D Renderer
and the 3D Renderer can't both work at the same time, so we decided to showcase the crosshair
scene as separate from the town scene. In the future, the engine will allow for simultaneous
2D and 3D rendering.

## About the project

Wiwa engine is a 3D Game Engine developed during the Game Engines subject. Our goal is to fulfill an Engine that can be used to develop all kinds of games. The engine is based on a full ECS system, and it's meant to have modern features as PBR and C# scripting.

- FBX model loading
- PNG texture loading
- Own custom file format
- Scene manager
- Camera manager
- Scene serialization

- Mouse picking
- AABB support
- WIP scriting ECS

## Authors

Currently we are two students working on the project

- Víctor Falcón [@ZaroDev](https://github.com/ZaroDev)
- Pablo Llorente [@Xymaru](https://github.com/Xymaru)

## Installing

In order to install the project you can

```git clone https://github.com/ZaroDev/WiwaEngine```

## Compiling

Dependencies:

- Visual Studio 2019 or more

Open the **``Scripts``** folder and then select your Visual Studio version at **``GenerateProjectsX.bat``**
Create a **``Assets``** folder at the **``Editor``** folder

Advise: the project only supports Windows

## How to use

### Entities

To create an entity left click on the Hierarchy window and select an option. You can create either a blank entity or a primitive.

Entities can have be parented and have local and global positions.

### Editor Camera

- Hold right click to look  
- Right click + WASD to move
- F to focus the selected entity
- Alt + right click to orbit an entity
- Alt + Q to quit the app
- Q to unselect the current gizmo
- W to move an object
- E to rotate an object
- R to scale

### Camera Manager

To create a camera just open the ``Cameras`` panel from ``View->Cameras`` then ``Create Camera``. To make the camera frustum cull the option cull needs to be active.

### Resource Manager

The resource manager automatically imports each ``Model`` or ``Texture`` from the ``Assets\`` folder, the result of that import can be seen in the generated ``Library\``.
The resources once loaded they keep loaded until a new scene is loaded. This keeps the engine from loading and unloading assets in a middle of a scene.
To see the loaded resources open the ``Resources`` window from ``View->Resources``.

To change the import options of an asset the ``Import`` window can be checked.

``Note: for now image import settings is WIP``

### Materials

To create a material click the button Create Material at the Assets window.

Open the material editor window and select a material you want to edit.

### Projects WIP

For now projects only contain info about the project such as the company and project name.
In the future this tab will allow the user to select the scenes from the project to build the game.

### Time

The play and pause buttons allow the user to enter play mode. This allows the ``deltaTime`` to be updated each frame, and in the future will make the scripting work. The time variables and time scale can be seen under the ``Time`` tab at ``View->Configuration``
